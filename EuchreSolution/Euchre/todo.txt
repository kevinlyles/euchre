---Reminders---

Keyboard stuff
- ctrl + shift click (go to definition)
- ctrl + shift + right click (go back)

Next rewrite
- Write so that things don't call each other as awkwardly as they did.
  Maybe have some functions that are way super simple and just keep looping until they get interrupted by a human player.
  Then the human player call just iterates the player and starts the cycle again
- Write with AI vs AI as a default with human interruptions
- Unit testing
- Somehow make it clear which functions also involve animation
