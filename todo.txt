Redo initialize for hands/tricks
Get rid of redeal. newHand should handle that
Make sure we use ID and Name in all var/param names. Also pass params more consistently

- Going alone
- Defending alone
- Sort the hand by trump/value
- Option for open hands
- Allow for no trump
- Stick the dealer
- AI difficulties
- Show cards played this hand
- Fun modes
  - AIs can see open hands but you can't. No one will find this fun. Do it anyway.
- Multiplayer
- Deck choice
- Picking dealer randomly
- Deal euchre style (who even cares)
- Steal the deal
- Cutthroat
- Card noises
- Make the whole thing resize with window
- Weird animation mode
- Setting for deal speed
- Clean up params that are just globals or can be retrieved from obj
- Game mode where you try to lose
