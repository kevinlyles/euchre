ToDo

Right meow functional

Clean up
- Organize functions better and comment everything

Enhancements
- Defending alone
- Make AI stuff way prettier
	- Stop doing things that make no sense in aiBehavior
	- playerAPI needs to expose a bunch more stuff
	- AI switch needs to be better (documentGlobal.aiFunction?)
	- Make vars private
- Queue up your next card
	- Get rid of delay at start of player 0's turn
- Card noises
- AI difficulties
- Show cards played this hand
- Stat mode
- Recenter hand after cards are played
- Option for open hands
- If your partner is going alone, you get to see the kitty (meow)
- Let functions handle multiple param types

Low priority
- Speedy (instant) AI players
- Auto-play last trick
- Auto-pass if it's all you can do
- Multiplayer
- Card pack choice
- Steal the deal
- Make the whole thing resize with window

Game modes
- No trump
- Stick the dealer
- Cutthroat
- AIs can see open hands but you can't. No one will find this fun (except Kevin). Do it anyway.
- Game mode where you try to lose


AI decisions that need to be made
- Some kind of init once it can see its hand
- Order up or not
- Bid on second round bidding
- Go alone
- Pick card to play

Keyboard stuff
- ctrl + shift click (go to definition)
- ctrl + shift + right click (go back)
